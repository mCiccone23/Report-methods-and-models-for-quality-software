## Software quality improvement project using sonarcloud and fortify

Utilizing tools such as SonarCloud and Fortify, we identified and resolved over 90% of the bugs and code smells. We applied refactoring techniques to enhance code quality, reducing technical debt to under 40 days and eliminating critical vulnerabilities and security hotspots. The project was carried out in a team environment, with Redmine used for task management and Maven for automated testing.
